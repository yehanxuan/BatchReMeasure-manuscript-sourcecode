# BatchReMeasure 
Batch effect correction with sample remeasurement in completely confounded case-control studies

## Overview 
BatchReMeasure implements batch effect correction with remeasured samples for a completely confounded case-control study. This repo contains the codes for our manuscript. The main functions are in the file 'code'. All the codes to reproduce the results in the manuscript are contained in 'Simulation' and 'RealData'. The users can find the scripts corresponding to the figure number in the manuscript.

## Reproducibility 
The codes that generate the plots are in the file 'figure'. The users can reproduce some of the plots based on the cached data in 'data' file. Due to the storage limit, we have only uploaded data for Fig4, 5, S8, S9, S10, S16, S17, and S18. Other data and information is available on request from the author (hanxuan@tamu.edu)
